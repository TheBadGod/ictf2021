# Puzzle 2

## Task

The evil presidential candidate Et3rnos is now forcing this poor game's players to vote on him in order to access the flag room. Can you teach him a lesson and get access to it without voting on him? The flag is in the format ICTF{[A-Z_]+}

## Solution

Since I already had stuff setup from puzzle 1 from the last month's
daily challenges I just opened the assembly dll in ILspy, exported
the source files, made a quick speed hack and clipped through the walls.
